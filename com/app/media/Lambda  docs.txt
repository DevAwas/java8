OOT interfaces
prodicate functional interface 
BiConsumer interface
-------------

closure example 


This references

in the ananonymous class , this reference refer the current instace of the class.

while in the lambda expression, this reference the class which is refer out site the lambda expression.


Method Reference:

it is applicable when we have no argument in lambda and call something.
like 
	() -> method()  will be replaces ClassName::methodName.
	
	if we have lambda expression like p -> System.out.println(p)
	this will also replace with  System.out::println . because System.out is a reference and calling println method which need a parameter and print it.
-------------------------
External Iterator:
					those iterator where we are managing the control for iterator of the objects.
example : for loop == where  we are initializing the index and iterating over that.
	or 
			for each loop== where we are saying the for each object of person, assign to the p variable and print it.
			
Internal iterator: 
					which say I need this to iterator but I don't want to tell which fashion. Let it descide at run time.
---------------Streams------------------------------------------------

Streams are the powerful operation which help to reduce line of code.
